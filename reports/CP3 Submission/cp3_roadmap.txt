Functionalities:
We plan to integrate the branch predictor, multiplier & devider, and SRAM cache as well as a victim cache to the original design. To meet the area constraint, we also plan to parameterized the cache to reduce the area of our memory system.

Work Assignment:
We will collaboratively integrate each individual module to one comprehensive design and debug the system as needed.
